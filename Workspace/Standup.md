# 2025-08-07

- AP-468 pushed SNS feature to aws dev for CLASS-cash, works well for test run, merged into main
- dont want push to prod now, we can deliver together with my next ticket the db query update
- AP-507 already start to tune the sql query, a little bit confused because of inconsistence of stg's bigsite, today may consult JB for help
- reviewed a series of PR from Matt for prod readiness, I also have a code lint branch on my local, will finalize it when I got time
- will have a GP appointment at lunch time

# 2025-08-06

- pushed ap-468 to dev tested for anz/apl ingest lambda in BGL project, works well
- also made the similar change for CLASS-cash, today will also to push to dev and have a test
- once class-cash test passed, we can have a CR to push the SNS configuration and Lambda event trigger to prod
- talked George about the internal sftp server, here is no available sftp server on prod, so we can only use selfwealth target in dev/stg
- created the related ssm/secret manager on dev and stg, the sftp lambda can works with these sftp configure, no connection failure anymore, I will raise a small PR for selfwealth target

# 2025-08-05

- update feedback for singleton aws resource
- finished the code change for ANZ/PCL ingestion lambda, involve 4 lambdas and the step function update, today will push to dev conduct integration testing

# 2025-08-04

- catched up with George about the SNS encrytion, the limitation is E3 event not works for the AWS manager KMS, so we decide to remove in encryption for the SNS
- raised a pullrequest which applied singleton for aws resource retrieving
- postgres migration pushed to stging, add works well for Matt's first model changeset

**todo**

- start to refactor ANZ and PCL ingestion Lambda to works SNS

# 2025-08-01

- for ap-468, I deployed the SNS topic for S3 and linked ANZ/PCL ingest lambda to SNS
    - Have to remove the encryption for KMS SNS, as if encrypted the s3 events can't be passed to lambda, george, not in yesterday I would like him know my change
    - Another change is our occurring to injection is accepting s3 events, what was even received from event is SNS event, so we have to create some warrant lambda to receive both S3 events and SNS event. SNS event works for when the file arriving in S3 bucket, S3 even works for historic file ingestion
- finally merged ap-392 postgres migration, tested on dev it works well, Today I will push to stg to let alembic handle stg db
- it's not a decent way as base64 is not encrypted encoding, and for the split jobs we have to manually approve twice if review require enabled
- it pass secret vars between GHA jobs via base64 encoding, George and Bhushan happy with that, but here actually have a potential nice solution which is get aws access key from the ec2 metadata then pass it into the python3.12 container
- Matt's PR is reviewing
- will review shivendra's new PR

# 2025-07-31

- Update SAM to link sns with ANZ/PCL ingest Lambda, today I will push everything to aws dev for a integration test
- Matt's PR started but not finished
- spend whole afternoon face to face catch up with Bhushan and George solve the dependency install issue in container, still have a secret value passing issue between github action jobs. They are happy for me to pass the secret in base64 encoding, I will have a try to pass the ec2 host 's IAM role or access key into the container.
- Today will have appointment in the noon
