When working with AWS Lambda and Python, it's crucial to use the right container image for the right job. AWS provides two main types:

### 1. Production Runtime Image üöÄ
This image is optimized for performance and security in a live environment. It's lightweight because it only contains the essential components needed to run your code.

- **Use for:** Production deployments.
- **Image:** `public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.12`

### 2. Development & Build Image üõ†Ô∏è
This image is larger and includes extra tools like compilers and package managers. It's designed to help you build your application and compile any dependencies during your development or CI/CD process.

- **Use for:** Development, testing, and building your function package.
- **Image:** `public.ecr.aws/sam/build-python3.12`

**Key Takeaway:** Use the `build` image to prepare your function, and the lean `lambda` image to run it in production. ‚úÖ

aws have two groups of containers for aws lambda
- public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.12
- public.ecr.aws/sam/build-python3.12

for production running use  public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.12
for dev/test/build turn to public.ecr.aws/sam/build-python3.12## üß† AWS Lambda Container Images: Prod vs. Dev
