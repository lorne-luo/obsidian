### üéØ Patching Pitfall: Relative Imports & `unittest.mock.patch`

When using Python's `@patch`, the path you provide is crucial, especially when dealing with relative imports.

#### The Knowledge üß†

The key is to **patch where an object is *looked up*, not where it's defined**. A relative import brings a name into your test module's local namespace, which can cause your patch to target the wrong location and fail silently.

---

#### The Problem ü§î

Using a relative import can make your patch ineffective. The test will run without errors, but the real function will be called instead of the mock.

**Example (Doesn't Work as Expected):**
```python
# Using a relative import to bring 'sync' into the local scope
from ..sync import some_function

# This patch targets the original location, but the test is using the *imported* one.
@patch("ingestion.arm_description.sync.get_bigsite_connection")
def test_with_relative_import():
    # The patch will not work here! ‚ö†Ô∏è
    ...
```

---

#### The Solution ‚úÖ

To fix this, ensure your import statement and patch path are aligned. Using an absolute import makes the target path unambiguous and reliable.

**Example (Works Correctly):**
```python
# Using an absolute import
from ingestion.arm_description.sync import some_function

# This patch correctly targets the object being used by the test.
@patch("ingestion.arm_description.sync.get_bigsite_connection")
def test_with_absolute_import():
    # The patch works perfectly! ‚ú®
    ...
```

**Bottom line:** Be mindful of your import paths when patching. Absolute imports often prevent these subtle but frustrating bugs. üëç

Relative import impact patch module path
``
```
from ..sync import ...

@patch("ingestion.arm_description.sync.get_bigsite_connection")  
def test()
    # it will not raise error, but the patch will not works as expected 
```

```  
from ingestion.arm_description.sync import ...  
  
@patch("ingestion.arm_description.sync.get_bigsite_connection")  def test()  
    # it works as expected
